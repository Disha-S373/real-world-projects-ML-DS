# Real-world-projects-ML-DS
A collection of real-world data science and machine learning projects demonstrating practical applications of EDA, ML, data visualization, and end-to-end pipelines using Python.

## üåç Real-World Projects Repository

This repository is dedicated to larger, practical projects where I apply data science and machine learning concepts to simulate or solve real-world problems.

### üß† Why this repository?

Unlike my mini-projects repo (which is more experimental and concept-based), this space focuses on:
- End-to-end pipelines
- Business context or real-world use cases
- Strong emphasis on model performance, deployment-readiness, and storytelling through data

These projects also help me:
- Build my portfolio
- Practice professional project structure
- Document real-world workflows and challenges

üîç *This repo reflects my evolution from a learner to a practitioner. Everything here is built with curiosity and commitment.*
